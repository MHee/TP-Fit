<h1>User Guide</h1>
<h2><em>Foreword</em></h2>
<p>This document describes software to estimate
the undisturbed physical state of unconsolidated or semi-consolidated
sediments measured with penetrating downhole tools. During the DSDP,
ODP, and IODP programs, many tools were developed and deployed to
measure formation temperatures and pore pressures. All of these
measurements exhibit a transient character due to the decay of
penetration induced disturbances of the state of the formation and time
constrains do not allow for the complete decay of the disturbances. For
all tools, different software solutions were developed to extrapolate
the transient data to undisturbed values. Even tough the code and the
user-interfaces of the programs are developed to very different stages
of sophistication, similar algorithms, based on the processing of
marine heat flux measurements (???, Villinger &amp; ???, ???), are used
in all programs. The measurements are compared with modeled data (e.g.
analytical, numerical, or analog models) for which the undisturbed
state is known ... The fundamental difference between all programs is
the uses model, which has to take into account the geometry of the used
probe.</p>
<p>The aim of this software is to provide a unified basis to process all of the different data types, described above.</p>
<p>The initial version of the software is designed
to work with data of the APCT tools and was especially developed to
make use of the enhanced data quality of the APCT-3 tool. Since there
is no difference in tool geometry between the APCT-3 and earlier
versions of the APCT, the software is able to handle data from both
tools. Additionally, it is developed to be easily extended for data
from other tools. </p>
<h2>First Steps</h2>
<p>This section gives an overview of the basic TP-Fit functionallity by guiding through an step-by-step tutorial.</p>
<h3>Launch TP-Fit</h3>
<p>Run the TPFit.m script in the TP-Fit\MatLab directory within Matlab
to launch the graphical user interface (GUI). See the section <a href="#1">Installation</a>
Installation for detailed instructions how to install and run TP-Fit. A
narrow window with some buttons representing the general
work-flow should pop up. Usually the buttons will be used from
top to bottom. </p>
<p><img src="images/mainmenu.png" /></p>
<h3>Import Data</h3>
<p>Load some data you want to process (e.g. the APCT-3 file
1329C09H.dat from the test data directory contains some good data!). It
is possible to import APCT (<em>.dat), APCT-3 (</em>.dat) and DVTP (<em>.eng)
data. Moreover, saved sessions (</em>.mat) (see below) can be loaded. The
first two buttons should turn green, signaling that data was
successfully imported and some basic Meta-data was created. If you have
loaded a Session file maybe also the Pick and the Compute contours
button turn green, depending on the session that was save. </p>
<p><img src="images/mainmenu_colored.png" />]</p>
<h3>Edit Meta Data</h3>
<p><img src="images/editmetadata.png" /></p>
<h3>Pick Data</h3>
<p>Now, provide some picks. Zoom into the region of interest (this
region is reused in the result plots, later on!!!) and pick of the tool
penetration time t0 and. Now, refine the picks in order to the select a
interval (unshaded region) of good data. The interval should consist of
as much smooth data as possible, but should not be too close to t0.
When you are Done, the Pick button should turn green. </p>

<img src="images/pickwindow02.png" />
<img src="images/pickwindow03.png" /></p>
<h3>Inspect Fit</h3>
<p>Show Fit gives a first result with standard sediment physical properties. <strong>(A)</strong> 
The upper plot shows the measurements (blue dots), the selected data
unshaded region) and the last third of the selected data (starting at
diamond). The reference model corresponding to the physical properties
(shown in lower right plot) is represented by a bold red line and
extrapolated temperatures (see below) are shown as dashed and dotted
lines. <strong>(B)</strong> The second plot shows the difference between data
and model, and reveals systematic deviations that cannot be recognized
in the first plot. <strong>(C)</strong> The lower left panel shows the
measurements plotted over the normalized reference model and
undisturbed temperatures (red circle and black dot on T-axis) are
extrapolated by linear regression. <strong>(D)</strong> The lower right panel
shows the standard deviation (black line with dots) between data and
model over the time-shift by which the model is shifted versus the
measured data (see Villinger &amp; ???,??? for explanation of the
time-shift). The optimal time-shift which is used in the previous plots
is marked by a blue open circle. After a mouse click into the axes, a
dashed and a dotted line show up. They show the sensitivity of
estimated undisturbed formation temperatures to time-shift changes.
With further clicks into the axes it is possible to inspect the effect
of different time-shifts (just try!!!). Clicking on the parameter box
opens a new window where it is possible to change the model parameters
k and rc. </p>

<p><img src="images/changephysprops01.png" /></p>
<h3>Compute Contours</h3>
<p>Now, take some time and compute the contour data that is used in
the next step .... If you change the picks of the used data window, the
contour data should be recalculated, but that is up to you and no
checks are done!!! </p>
<p>Explore, once Compute Contours turned green! A mouse click into one
of the contour plots will move the white dot and the results of the
corresponding physical properties will be displayed in the results plot
window. The red star represents the smallest standard deviation. The
valid physical properties for the result plot are not continuous.
Values are rounded to the closest tenth of the physical properties! </p>

<img src="images/results02.png" /></p>
<h3>Save Results</h3>
<p>It is possible to save any state of your work in a session file
(*.mat) and load and resume your work, later on. The session files also
contain all results that could be collected by a report generator. </p>
<p>The Make Report creates EPS-files of the current result and contour
plots in the data directory. Furthermore, a simple ASCII-report is
generated. </p>
<h3>Advanced Features</h3>
<p>Extras provides some interesting features and debugging tools,
which can be used at any time. If you moved and resized the figure
windows it is possible to save the positions. It is also possible to
export the current data structure to the work-space “Data” and inspect
how information is added from step to step, or to make a simple screen
dump of the data. Be careful if you want to import “Data” from the
workspace! </p>
<h2><a name="1"></a> Installation</h2>
<p>In order to run TP-Fit a recent version of
Matlab® (e.g. Version 7) is required. The installation is as simple as
unpacking the TP-Fit.zip file on your computer. A TP-Fit directory with
three subdirectories is created. </p>
<ol>
<li>The doc directory contains the sources for this document.</li>
<li>
The MatLab directory contains all parts that are necessary to run the program.
<ul>
<li>The TPFit.m, lauched within Matlab, sets some paths and runs the TP-Fit graphical user interface</li>
<li>The RefModels directory contains numerically computed reference curves (e.g. thermal response) for the supported downhole tools (currently APCT and DVTP). Further subdirectories contain the Femlab® models that where used to create the reference curves.</li>
<li>The TP-Fit directory contains Matlab functions used for the actual data processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The TestData directory contains some date files of different down-hole types for testing purposes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any suggestions or made changes to the documentation, or other files, please let me know, so I can include the changes in upcoming releases.</p>
